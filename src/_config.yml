    # too.

    solutions: |
      Solutions to most exercises are <a href="https://github.com/cs3110/textbook-solutions">available</a>.
      Fall 2022 is the first public release of these solutions.
      Though they have been available to Cornell students for a few years,
      it is inevitable that wider circulation will reveal improvements that
      could be made. We are happy to add or correct solutions. Please make
      contributions through GitHub.
